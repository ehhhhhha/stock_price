# stock_price

This is a simple django project with Chart.js. 

Access http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the main page.

All raw stock data are stored at '/csv' folder and are all downloaded from intrinio.com.
  
ps: I noticed that some of these data might be incorrect since I compared them with the data from other financial websites.
